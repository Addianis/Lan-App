# Lan-App

LAG-C

An idea where the objective is to bring back the LAN party days as well as bringing board games back to the forefront.  Bring friends closer and meet new people.
Started with the idea of myself wanting to find people near me who are interested in learning and playing GO with me.
 
An app where you can log on to a “community” of your choosing and find people in your area who are interested in playing the same board game or video game as you.
The clean UI of the PY app on the app store will be used as an inspiration for the app design.
